**During business hours**, I'm a digital product designer having experience working with advertising agencies, automotive businesses, fashion brands, financial institutions and tech startups.

Previously, I was the Sr. User Experience Designer at [Fabletics][url-fabletics] before I ventured off to start my first business, [CVMPUS][url-cvmpus].

**After hours**, I'm either spending time with my adventure partner, bedroom lover and best fuckin' homie, Alexandra, with our son, Arro, or working on my newest project, [Candy](https://candymotor.co).

### The reasoning behind 'AWWWRY'

People usually pronounce my name as `/air-eee/` or `/are-eye`, so I chose the word awry to solve that phonetic issue and added two extra Ws because, being a nerd, I needed the initials from world wide web sandwiched in my name.`

### How I get around

I used to brap around on a '99 Harley-Davidson Sportster, but sold it because after Arro was born:
- I only had time to jam around the city about once a month
- I was seeing/reading more and more accidents on my social feed
- Straight up, I needed the money at the time ‚Äî this ninja had bills to pay

Now I truck around in a 2017 Ford F-150 and I love beastin' it on the road and in compact parking spaces. I have a few more mods to do, but for now she's hella thicc to me.
