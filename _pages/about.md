**During business hours**, I day trade options and swing credit spreads. Previously, I was a front-end designer with over 3,650 days of experience doing lines of code and smuggling designs above the fold.

Recently, I was the Sr. User Experience Designer at [Fabletics][url-fabletics] before I ventured off to start my first business, [CVMPUS][url-cvmpus].

**After hours**, my time is spent with my adventure partner and bedroom lover, Alexandra, and our son, Arro.
