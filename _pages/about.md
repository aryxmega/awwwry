Previously, I was the Sr. User Experience Designer at [Fabletics][url-fabletics] before I ventured off to start my first business, [CVMPUS][url-cvmpus].

**After hours**, I'm either spending time with my adventure partner, bedroom lover and best fuckin' homie, Alexandra, with our son, Arro, or working on my newest project, [Candy](/blog/candy).

#### The reasoning behind 'AWWWRY'

People usually pronounce my name as `/air-eee/` or `/are-eye`, so I chose the word **awry** to solve that phonetic issue and added two extra Ws because I needed the initials from world wide web sandwiched in my name.
