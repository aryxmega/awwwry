### I'm Ary &mdash; an American-Indonesian father and fianc&eacute; from Los Angeles, California.

During business hours, I'm a [product designer and front-end developer][url-my-work] to clients in various industries, but my main jam is with advertising agencies, automotive businesses, fashion brands and financial tech companies.

After hours, you can catch me outside spending time with my partner, Alexandra, our son, Arro, or working on my newest project, [Candy](https://candymotor.co).

### I used to brap around on a cute ass '99 Harley-Davidson Sportster...

...but sold it because:

* After Arro was born, I only had time to brap around the city about once a month
* Seen/read too many accidents; didn't matter before, but now that I'm father I gotta be more careful lane splittin'
* Needed money at the time because this ninja had bills and shit

Now I truck around in a 2017 Ford F-150 and I love beastin' it out on the road and compact parking spots. I still have a few more mods to do on 'er but for now she's hella thicc.
