## `[Unreleased]`

## `[1.0.0]`

**Unreleased** is usually a section at the top to track upcoming changes (usually in development) and serves two main purposes:

1. People can see what changes they can expect in upcoming releases
2. At release time, the `Unreleased` section changes into a new release version section
