### I'm Ary &mdash; an American-Indonesian father and fianc&eacute; from Los Angeles, California.

During business hours, I'm a product designer and front-end developer. After hours, I'm either spending time with my adventure partner, bedroom lover and best fuckin' homie, Alexandra, and our son, Arro, or working on my newest project, [Candy](https://candymotor.co).

I've had the opportunity work with advertising agencies, automotive businesses, fashion brands and financial tech companies.

Previously, I was the Sr. UX Designer at [Fabletics][url-fabletics] before I ventured off to start my own business, [CVMPUS][url-cvmpus], which I closed in 2019.

### The reasoning behind 'AWWWRY'

People usually pronounce my name as `/air-eee/` or `/are-eye`, so I chose the word awry to solve that phonetic issue and added two extra Ws because, being a nerd, I needed the initials from world wide web sandwiched in my name.

### How I get around

I used to brap around on a '99 Harley-Davidson Sportster, but sold it because after Arro was born, I only had time to jam around the city about once a month, I was seeing/reading more and more accidents on my social feed and, straight up, I needed the money at the time — this ninja had mad bills to pay.

Now I truck around in a 2017 Ford F-150 and I love beastin' it on the road and in compact parking spaces. I have a few more mods to do, but for now she's hella thicc to me.
