In 2013, I slid into ShoeDazzle's DM as their User Experience Designer. By 2015, I bribed my way to become the Global Sr. User Experience Designer for TechStyle Fashion Group — the parent company — with epic fist bumps and flawless dance battles.

#### Growth strategy

TechStyle Fashion Group was one of the first companies to bring fast fashion online and to launch the fast-fashion footwear category. From there, we began offering jewelry, handbags and apparel.

Our exceptional growth is fueled by our ability to incubate new brands, extend product lines, expand internationally and innovate repeatedly in omni-channel commerce.
