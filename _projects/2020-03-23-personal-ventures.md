In 2018, I started a do-it-yourself garage. In 2019, I started building my second venture. In 2020, I'm WFH because of COVID-19.

## CVMPUS

[CVMPUS][url-cvmpus] was my first business venture I started in 2018 after leaving [TechStyle Fashion Group][url-techstyle]. It was South Bay's first do-it-yourself garage — located in Hawthorne, California. Unfortch, I had to close in 2019.

#### During my time @CVMPUS
- Did most of the renovations myself, with help from friends on occassional weekends and watching YouTube videos
- Funded the entire project with personal funds
- Made many trips to, and spent lots of money at, Home Depot, Harbor Freight and Sherwin-Williams
- Had the most [supportive partner][url-alexandra] anyone could ever ask for; taking care of our infant while I was tryna make my dreams come to life 10-12 hours a day, 6 days a week

#### Key takeaways
- This was the most expensive learning experience I ever had
- I should've raised more capital
- An undertaking that huge, would've been helpful to have a business partner
- I learned that I can't do everything (on my own)
- Start small and scale; build a community first
- Made me realize how much I missed spending time with my family
