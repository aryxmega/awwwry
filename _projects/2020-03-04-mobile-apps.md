As a mobile app designer (primarily for iOS), I follow three main design principles to maximize impact and reach for the brand and user:

- Aesthetic Integrity
- Consistency
- User Control

#### Wireframes help put the idea together as quickly as possible.

Sometimes, when you put the pieces together, it may not turn out how you envisioned — and that's how it's suppose to be. This is where revisions and user testings party the most.

{% include post-components/gallery.html
	columns = 2
	full_width = true
	images = "/images/projects/mobile-app/mobile-app-wireframes-01.png,/images/projects/mobile-app/mobile-app-wireframes-02.png"
%}

#### Once wireframes are finalized, it's time to give it some color with visual designs.

This is where pixels matter the most — not just for the users, but for the developers too.

My style is either clean and minimal or dark and technical. It isn't for everyone and I'm okay with that.

{% include post-components/gallery.html
	columns = 2
	full_width = true
	images = "/images/projects/mobile-app/mobile-app-ecommerce-01.png,/images/projects/mobile-app/mobile-app-ecommerce-02.png,/images/projects/mobile-app/mobile-app-food-01.png,/images/projects/mobile-app/mobile-app-food-02.png"
%}

#### From blogs, to e-commerce and everything in between.

If I believe in the product or idea, I will design it.

{% include post-components/gallery.html
	columns = 1
	full_width = true
	images = "/images/projects/mobile-app/mobile-app-wireframes.png,/images/projects/mobile-app/mobile-app-02.png,/images/projects/mobile-app/mobile-app-03.png,/images/projects/mobile-app/mobile-app-food-01.png,/images/projects/mobile-app/mobile-app-food-02.png"
