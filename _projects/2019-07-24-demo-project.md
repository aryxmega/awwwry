#### Link-up the stylesheet in your <head>

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style/sheet.css">
```

#### Structurin' your layouts real nasty.
```html
<div class="wrap">
    <div class="block-3">Content here</div>
    <div class="block-3">Content here</div>
    <div class="block-3">Content here</div>
</div>

#### Gettin' fluid widdit.
Maybe you want to kick-it old school and create a two-column layout based on percentage. It's mad simps â€” you just need to know basic math (as long as the `.block-` classes equal 100%, it will be fire ðŸ”¥).
```html
<div class="wrap">
    <div class="block-75">Some rad content here</div>
    <div class="block-25">Some informational content here</div>
</div>
```

#### That's it.
