May 16th, 2020, would’ve been the day Alexandra and I became husband and wife. Due to COVID-19, we had to cancel our original wedding plans.

Fast-forward a few months, we couldn’t wait any longer and decided to get married and say our vows to each other in Joshua Tree, California, in front of our son, Arro, my folks and our friend, David, taking photographs and video — on August 28th, 2020.

#### Urban Dictionary defines love as finding somebody you want to share 23 huskies with. I'm about that.

Alex, before I met you, I thought I had my life figured out. To be honest, I didn't think I'd be a husband — let alone a father. But you gave me both and I wouldn't have it any other way.

I remember seeing you for the first time. You offered me cookies at the office. I knew right then and there I wanted to wife you up. There was something about you that drew me in — like a magnet. I couldn't stay away.

As we spent more time together, I realized how caring and thoughtful you are. You always think of others with gifts, small gestures and the kindest words. It's one of the reasons that made me fall in love with you.

The other reason was your cooking. Hot damn can you cook delicious meals. I love that you're a perfectionist. You've probably made over 743 pizzas for us over the last four years and you perfect it every time. Not to mention they're healthy, too.

#### Because you care about me; you genuinely care about my well-being.

What I eat, what appointments I need to make, lifting me up when I'm down, believing in me when I don't even believe in myself at times.

You challenge me; you challenge us.

You always keep us in check to make sure the flame is still lit between us. Being with you *is* lit. It's crazy how I found my life partner at 800 Apollo Street on a Tuesday afternoon in between meetings. From countless concerts, road trips, comedy shows and more.

I'm so lucky to experience all that with you — especially on May 4th, 2018, when we became parents. I knew long before then I found the future mother of my kids. Everything about you told me you were going to be an amazing mother.

Every time I see how loving you are to our child makes me tear up inside because I finally have it all — a partner who I'm in love with and can now call my wife and a wild, crazy son who makes us laugh constantly. I have my own little family now and that's everything to me.

Alex, I'm so excited to continue our lives together as husband and wife because after all we've been through — the ups, the downs, the lefts and rights — we always go to bed saying, "I love you", and I know we can get through anything together — as a family.

#### Before I get too emotional, I just want to say...

I admire you, I respect you, I'll always protect you and keep our family safe, I'll always keep you laughing and continue to help you grow and I'll always say I love you before bed.

I love you.

PS, you want to order Chinese tonight?
