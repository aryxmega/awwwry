### I'm currently reading (or rather listening to) How To Be Fucking Awesome, by Dan Meredith, and it's fucking awesome.

In a phat nutshell, the book basically shows how you can achieve your goals using the author's principles, that it's okay to be selfish and that you need to be yourself in order to be successful â€”Â among other lessons.
