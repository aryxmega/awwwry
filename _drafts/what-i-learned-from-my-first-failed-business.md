description: A story how I left my 9-to-5 office job to open my first business, only to fail and soak in what I learned from the entire experience for my next venture.

I was with [TechStyle Fashion Group](https://www.techstyle.com) as a **Sr. Product Designer** from August 2013 - October 2018, when I decided to take the leap to quit and start my own business, [@CVMPUS](https://www.instagram.com/cvmpus).

Got the keys to a 6,000+ sq. ft. auto garage around Thanksgiving of 2018, poured over $100K of personal funds into it and closed up shop, before it officially opened, around May of 2019.

In this story, I'm going to share exactly what I did, what I learned and what I'll do differently in my venture.

## Here's what happened:

#### Registering for an LLC & DBA.
I used [LegalZoom](https://www.legalzoom) to file and register my LLC *(ARMY x Co LLC)* and filed for a DBA *(doing business as)* with the name **CVMPUS**.

#### Creating a business account.
When I got the paperwork back saying I was officially an LLC with an EIN *(employer identification number, similar to a social security number if you didn't know)*, I went to Chase Bank to open a business checking and savings account, along with a business credit card so I could separate my personal spending and my business.

#### Finding a location.
I used [Loopnet](https://www.loopnet.com) to look for a location. Since I was going to be opening a do-it-yourself garage, I filtered the list to only show me buildings specifically for industrial use.

Found a few potential spots and made an appointment with several brokers to see the different properties.

I finally found the ideal spot, located at [4471 West Rosecrans Avenue](https://www.google.com/maps/place/4471+Rosecrans+Ave,+Hawthorne,+CA+90250/@33.9022441,-118.3567158,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x80c2b4312ea34bd7:0xbe8d08a8c4a44364!8m2!3d33.9022441!4d-118.3545271) in Hawthorne, California.

At just over 6,000 sq. ft., the monthly cost of the property was around $9,000 with an additional $2,000 for the [NNN](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/triple-net-lease-nnn.asp), AKA triple net lease.

> In total, I was paying a little over *$11,000/month* — just on the property.

After signing contracts and puttin' down two month's worth *(just over $22,0000)*, I finally got the keys to the property.

> Just in rent alone, I spent over *$88,000* from November 2018 - May 2019.

#### Gettin' a permit from the city.
After I secured my new location, I went down to Hawthorne's city hall to acquire a permit to operate and do business. It took some time, but I was finally able to get one as a **motorcycle repair shop**.

> Permit and application fee was around *$200*.

#### Renovation was a bitch.
When I took over the shop, there was so much stuff left behind *(I take full blame on that because I told the previous owner to leave it all because there were, what I thought, a lot of useful parts I could use/sell — I was 98% wrong)*. It looked like the feature film of Hoarders. So first thing was to throw everything out.

I rented a 40-yard dumpster, from Waste Management, that costed me about $400 each time they dropped it off *(no charge when they picked it up)*. I ended up using it about 6-7 times.

> Total spent on renting dumpsters to throw everything out was just over *$3,000*.

After everything was thrown out, it was time to paint. In total, I bought about 20 of the 5-gallon buckets. I had the exterior of the building professionally painted, which cost me about **$3,000**, on just the service *(not including the paint)*. Fortunately, I had help from my cousin to paint the interior.

> For (20) 5-gallon buckets of paint, plus the professional painters, I spent about *$6,000*.

Then it was time to install the signage.

> Having the CVMPUS signage created and installed ran me about *$4,000*.

Not going to lie, it looked so sick.

Next, I ordered a bunch of equipment and hardware:

* Motorcycle lifts
* Tech carts
* Tools (lots of 'em)
* Fitness equipment *(one aspect of CVMPUS was to have a fitness area to train)*
* Tables
* LED / Lights
* Toilets & other bathroom equipment
* Automatic gate with remote control

> I spent about *$16,000* for everything listed above.

On top of all that, I spent around **$10,000** for 7-month's worth of internet, weekly garage collection, gas, water, electricity and miscellaneous things — such as marketing/online promotions, supplies for events and second-hand furniture from Facebook Marketplace and [OfferUp](https://offerup.com/).

> I had this mentality of, "This is going to work; it's going to be awesome. I have it all figured out."

The reality is, I didn't. I didn't have it all figured out. I never tackled a project of this scale before — but I had that drive and motivation that I was going to make sure it succeeds no matter what. And my biggest motivation was *(and still is)* my family: **Alexandra and Arro**.

They're my reason why I took that risk and my reason why I'll continue taking risks. They're my biggest supporters and believers — even when I didn't believe in myself at times.

#### And just like that, I locked up the shop one last time.
Around May of 2019, I was hit with a personal matter that left me with no other choice but to close CVMPUS, before it officially opened.

## What I'll do differently based on this experience

#### Start small, very small, then scale.
One of my biggest mistakes with CVMPUS was that I didn't start small and build a following.

If I could start over with my $140K, instead of filing for an LLC, opening a business account and securing a location, I would've built a community on social media — where it's easy and free.

Once I had a decent following, I should've asked the community, **"Would anyone actually be interested in a do-it-yourself garage?"** If there was a bigger response on the yes side, I would've moved forward with a small location — way smaller than what I had — with just 1,000 - 2,000 sq. ft. property.

And:

1. Numbered lists
2. Like this other one
3. Are great too

You can also add blockquotes, which are shown at a larger width to help break up the layout and draw attention to key parts of your content:

> “Simple can be harder than complex: You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple. But it’s worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains.”

The theme also supports markdown tables:

| Item                 | Author        | Supports tables? | Price |
|----------------------|---------------|------------------|-------|
| Duet Jekyll Theme    | Jekyll Themes | Yes              | $49   |
| Index Jekyll Theme   | Jekyll Themes | Yes              | $49   |
| Journal Jekyll Theme | Jekyll Themes | Yes              | $49   |

And footnotes[^1], which link to explanations[^2] at the bottom of the page[^3].

You can throw in some horizontal rules too:

#### Image galleries

Here's a really neat custom feature we added – galleries:

{% include post-components/gallery.html
	columns = 2
	full_width = true
	images = "/images/demo.jpg,/images/demo.jpg,/images/demo.jpg,/images/demo.jpg,
	"
%}

Inspired by the Galleries feature from WordPress, we've made it easy to create grid layouts for your images. Just use a simple Liquid snippet in your post to create a masonry grid image layout:

{% raw %}
```liquid
{% include post-components/gallery.html
	columns = 2
	full_width = true
	images = "/images/demo.jpg,/images/demo.jpg,/images/demo.jpg,/images/demo.jpg,
	"
%}
```
{% endraw %}

*See what we did there? Code and syntax highlighting is built-in too!*

Change the number inside the 'columns' setting to create different types of gallery for all kinds of purposes. You can even click on each image to seamlessly enlarge it on the page.


#### Image carousels

Here's another gallery with only one column, which creates a carousel slide-show instead.

A nice little feature: the carousel only advances when it is in view, so your visitors won't scroll down to find it half way through your images.

{% include post-components/gallery.html
	columns = 1
	full_width = true
	images = "/images/demo.jpg,/images/demo.jpg,/images/demo.jpg
	"
%}

#### What about videos?

Videos are an awesome way to show off your work in a more engaging and personal way, and we’ve made sure they work great on our themes. Just paste an embed code from YouTube or Vimeo, and the theme makes sure it displays perfectly:

{% include post-components/video.html
	url = "https://player.vimeo.com/video/270725085?color=6c6e95&title=0&byline=0"
	full_width = true
%}

### Pretty cool, huh?

We've packed this theme with powerful features to show off your work.
Why not put them to use on your new website?
