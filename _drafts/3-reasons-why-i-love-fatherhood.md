### I never had any plans on becoming a father.

My thoughts were along the lines of, "If it happens, awesome. If it doesn't, not the end of the world." So when Alexandra and I found out in August of 2017 that we were going to be parents, I was supes overwhelmed.

But as time went on, man, I was stoked. I was like, "Fuck yeah, bro. I'm going to have a little version of me and watch my [ROI][url-roi] grow."

May 4th, 2018, became the best fucking day of my life because that's when the little homie slid into our DMs like...

Now, Arro (our son), is about to hit that 2-year mark and before he goes through his tantrum phase, here are my top three reasons why I love fatherhood so far:

### Reason 1: I have a purpose now

I used to live life without a savings account, racking up the bill at my favorite [Irish pub][url-tom-bergins] and just buy shit because I had extra money in the bank.

Now, it's the complete opposite.

I used to throw anything and everything in my cart at Target. Now, I'm actually comparing prices to save that extra dollar because now I have a purpose in life — to take care of my child by any means necessary. From carefree life, to careful life, I wouldn't have it any other way because I'm learning more about myself and life — like what a savings account is.

### Reason 2: My child is a better version of me

### Reason 3: I finally have a little family of my own

My childhood was pretty dope. My parents would shower me with love, gifts and sacrafices. I didn't know what efforts and resources went into those things, but now as a family man, I totes get it.
