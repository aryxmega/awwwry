I was with [TechStyle Fashion Group](https://www.techstyle.com) as a **Sr. User Experience Designer** from August 2013 - October 2018, when I decided to take the leap and quit to start my own business, [@CVMPUS](https://www.instagram.com/cvmpus).

Got the keys to a 6,000+ sq. ft. auto garage around Thanksgiving of 2018, poured over $140K of personal funds into it and closed up shop, before it officially opened, around May of 2019.

In this story, I'm going to share exactly what I did, what I learned and what I'll do differently in my future ventures.

Here's what happened:

### Registering for an LLC & DBA.
I used [LegalZoom](https://www.legalzoom) to file and register my LLC *(ARMY x Co LLC)* and filed for a DBA *(doing business as)* with the name **CVMPUS**.

### Creating a business account.
When I got the paperwork back saying I was officially an LLC with an EIN *(employer identification number, similar to a social security number if you didn't know)*, I went to Chase Bank to open a business checking and savings account, along with a business credit card so I could separate my personal spending and my business.

### Finding a location.
I used [Loopnet](https://www.loopnet.com) to look for a location. Since I was going to be opening a do-it-yourself garage, I filtered the list to only show me buildings specifically for `industrial` use.

Found a few potential spots and made an appointment with several brokers to see the different properties.

I finally found the ideal spot, located at [4471 West Rosecrans Avenue](https://www.google.com/maps/place/4471+Rosecrans+Ave,+Hawthorne,+CA+90250/@33.9022441,-118.3567158,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x80c2b4312ea34bd7:0xbe8d08a8c4a44364!8m2!3d33.9022441!4d-118.3545271) in Hawthorne, California.

At just over 6,000 sq. ft., the monthly cost of the property was around $9,000 with an additional $2,000 for the [NNN](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/triple-net-lease-nnn.asp), AKA triple net lease.

> In total, I was paying a little over *$11,000/month* â€” just on the property.

After signing contracts and puttin' down two month's worth *(just over $22,0000)*, I finally got the keys to the property.

> Just in rent alone, I spent over *$88,000* from November 2018 - May 2019.

### Gettin' a permit from the city.
After I secured my new location, I went down to Hawthorne's city hall to acquire a permit to operate and do business. It took some time, but I was finally able to get one as a **motorcycle repair shop**.

> Permit and application fee was around *$200*.

### Renovation was a bitch.
When I took over the shop, there was so much stuff left behind *(I take full blame on that because I told the previous owner to leave it all because there were, what I thought, a lot of useful parts I could use/sell â€” I was 98% wrong)*. It looked like the feature film of Hoarders. So first thing was to throw everything out.

I rented a 40-yard dumpster, from Waste Management, that costed me about $400 each time they dropped it off *(no charge when they picked it up)*. I ended up using it about 6-7 times.

> Total spent on renting dumpsters to throw everything out was just over *$3,000*.

After everything was thrown out, it was time to paint. In total, I bought about 20 of the 5-gallon buckets. I had the exterior of the building professionally painted, which cost me about **$3,000**, on just the service *(not including the paint)*. Fortunately, I had help from my cousin to paint the interior.

> For (20) 5-gallon buckets of paint, plus the professional painters, I spent about *$6,000*.

Then it was time to install the signage.

> Having the CVMPUS signage created and installed ran me about *$4,000*.

Not going to lie, it looked so sick.

Next, I ordered a bunch of equipment and hardware:

* Motorcycle lifts
* Tech carts
* Tools (lots of 'em)
* Fitness equipment *(one aspect of CVMPUS was to have a fitness area to train)*
* Tables
* LED / Lights
* Toilets & other bathroom equipment
* Automatic gate with remote control

> I spent about *$16,000* for everything listed above.

On top of all that, I spent around **$10,000** for 7-month's worth of internet, weekly garage collection, gas, water, electricity and miscellaneous things â€” such as marketing/online promotions, supplies for events and second-hand furniture from Facebook Marketplace and [OfferUp](https://offerup.com/).

> I had this mentality of, "This is going to work; it's going to be awesome. I have it all figured out."

The reality is, I didn't. I didn't have it all figured out. I never tackled a project of this scale before â€” but I had that drive and motivation that I was going to make sure it succeeds no matter what. And my biggest motivation was *(and still is)* my family: **Alexandra and Arro**.

They're my reason why I took that risk and my reason why I'll continue taking risks. They're my biggest supporters and believers â€” even when I didn't believe in myself at times.

### And just like that, I locked up the shop one last time.
Around May of 2019, I was hit with a personal matter that left me with no other choice but to close CVMPUS, before it officially opened.

### What I'll do differently based on this experience.

### Start small, very small, then scale.
One of my biggest mistakes with CVMPUS was that I didn't start small and build a following.

If I could start over with my $140K, instead of filing for an LLC, opening a business account and securing a location, I would've built a community on social media â€” where it's easy and free.

Once I had a decent following, I should've asked the community, **"Would anyone actually be interested in a do-it-yourself garage?"** If there was a bigger response on the yes side, I would've moved forward with a small location â€” way smaller than what I had â€” with just 1,000 - 2,000 sq. ft. property.
